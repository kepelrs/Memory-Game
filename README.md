# Memory Game Project

## Information

This project is a part of the Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree.

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. My job was to make it interactive with CSS, Javascript and some HTML.

The game itself an implementation of your classic childhood memory game. The goal is to turn a card face up and then find/remember where it's pair was located and turn that face up as well. If you miss both cards get turn down again.

The game tracks how many moves, as well as how much time you took to complete the game.
